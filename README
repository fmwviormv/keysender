A simple program to send keyboard events automatically.
It will ask you to enter E and Space keys to get their scan codes.
Then it will repeat following tasks:

	SendE:		press E key (one time),

	SendJump:	press Space key repeatedly for 34 seconds,

	Wait:		wait for 19 seconds.


WHY?

While I was playing Cyberpunk 2077, I found that it is so difficault to
improve Athletics.  I found a place with short roof, so I could jump
repeatedly to improve my Athletics; but it was too slow.  I wrote this
program to do this job for me :D
